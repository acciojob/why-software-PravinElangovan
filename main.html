	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Because I enjoy problem-solving and creating solutions. Software development provides an opportunity to take complex ideas and turn them into functioning applications that people can use. This process can be very satisfying, especially when the solution you created is well received by users.</p>
